# PHAS0077-project
# Background
This repository is for my project "using machine learning to predict hospital mergers". This project applied seven machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbor. Except XGBoost (**xgboost** package created by Tianqi Chen), all methods used **sklearn** package. Different sampling methods were used to find the best-performing one.

# Installation
**xgboost** and **imblearn** package was required to install for this project.

**imblearn** package was used for undersampling and oversampling methods.

**Numpy**, **pandas**, **seaborn** and **scikit-learn**  package are included in Anaconda and usually don't need to be reinstalled. If not included, install it with pip (pip install scikit-learn).

## Install using `pip` (recommend):
Open your terminal such as git bash, browse to the directory where this file lives, and run
```
$ pip install xgboost
$ pip install imblearn
```
## Install using `conda`:
```
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
conda install -c anaconda py-xgboost
```
```
conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
```

# Structure of the repostiory:
* Readme
* gitignore
* Data files (csv files)\
Files named beginning with 'ime_gme' are HCRIS data; 'closures_verified_2019_04_short.csv' is the verified data from Professor Lina Song; 'hosp_closest_info_v5.csv' is the multi-source data; 'verified_hcris_data_2012' is the combined data (verified and HCRIS) I created for checking the study sample.
* data_processing.py\
data_processing.py contains functions used for data processing.
* grid_search.py\
grid_search.py contains functions using GridSearchCV and pipeline to tune hyperparameters for different sampling methods.
* Jupyternotebook files (ipynb files)\
'Using HCRIS (approach 1).ipynb' and 'Using HCRIS (approach 2)-mean/median imputaion.ipynb' applied ML algorithms on HCRIS data using 2 different ways to resample the imbalance data respectively (see section 3.4 in my project). According to the results, approach 2 is the appropriate way to apply resampling methods (section 4.2.2). For 'Using HCRIS (approach 2)-mean imputation' and 'Using HCRIS (approach 2)-median imputation', you could just run the mean one and change the cell under the markdown "impute missing values:" in the notebook to other methods (median, knn and multivariate) using 'imputation_method'. If you want to try random imputation, uncomment the cell below "If using random imputation..." and comment the cell under "Imputate missing values".
'Using multi-source data.ipynb' applied ML algorithms on the multi-source data using approach 2. You could run these ipynb files for results.
