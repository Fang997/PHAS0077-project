# PHAS0077-project
# Background
This repository is for my project "using machine learning to predict hospital mergers". This project applied seven machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbor. Except XGBoost, all methods used **sklearn** package. Different sampling methods were used to find the best-performing one.

# Installation
**xgboost** and **imblearn** package was required to install for this project.

**imblearn** package was used for undersampling and oversampling methods.


## Install using `pip`:

```
$ pip install xgboost
$ pip install imblearn
```

## Structure of repostiory:
* Readme
* gitignore
* Data files (csv files)\
Files named beginning with 'ime_gme' are HCRIS data; 'closures_verified_2019_04_short.csv' is the verified data from Professor Lina Song; 'hosp_closest_info_v5.csv' is the multi-source data; 'verified_hcris_data_2012' is the combined data (verified and HCRIS) I created for checking the study sample.
* data_processing.py\
data_processing.py contains functions used for data processing.
* grid_search.py\
grid_search.py contains functions using GridSearchCV and pipeline to tune hyperparameters for different sampling methods.
